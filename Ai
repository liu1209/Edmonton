SharePoint Transition Plan

1. Project Overview

	•	Project Name:
	•	Current SharePoint Site Name
	•	New SharePoint Site Name
	•	Objective:
	•	Smoothly transition to the new SharePoint site while ensuring content completeness and accessibility.
	•	Minimize downtime and impact on users.

2. Current State Assessment

	•	Existing SharePoint Site Overview:
	•	Number of pages (e.g., 60 pages)
	•	Total files and types (e.g., documents, images, spreadsheets)
	•	Content structure (Main site and sub-sites)
	•	Permissions and user roles
	•	Content Categorization:
	•	Must-migrate content
	•	Archivable content
	•	Non-essential content

3. Inputs for the Transition Plan

Before developing the plan, gather the following inputs:

	•	Content Inventory of Current SharePoint:
	•	List of pages and hierarchical structure
	•	File and document inventory (folder paths)
	•	Current user permissions
	•	Requirements for the New SharePoint Site:
	•	Content structure and navigation design
	•	Page templates and layout requirements
	•	Permissions and access control
	•	New features or components (e.g., workflows or Web Parts)
	•	Constraints:
	•	Timeframe
	•	Migration tools (e.g., ShareGate, Microsoft Mover, manual migration)
	•	Data compatibility and formatting issues

4. Transition Plan Steps

Phase 1: Planning

	•	Prepare Content Inventory:
	•	Compile a comprehensive list of all pages, files, sub-sites, and permissions.
	•	Design New SharePoint Architecture:
	•	Define the new site’s structure, navigation, and page layouts.
	•	Permissions Review and Update:
	•	Ensure the new site’s permissions align with the old site’s or update as needed.

Phase 2: Data Migration

	•	Select and Configure Migration Tools:
	•	Test migration tools (e.g., ShareGate) for compatibility and performance.
	•	Content Migration Testing:
	•	Perform a small-scale migration test to ensure accuracy and completeness.
	•	Full-Scale Migration:
	•	Execute the bulk migration while verifying data integrity.

Phase 3: Quality Assurance

	•	Data Validation:
	•	Verify that all content has been migrated successfully.
	•	Ensure links, file paths, and permissions are accurate.
	•	User Testing:
	•	Involve a subset of users to test the functionality and navigation of the new site.
	•	Fixes and Optimizations:
	•	Address feedback and optimize the user experience.

Phase 4: Deployment

	•	Go-Live:
	•	Notify all users of the transition timeline.
	•	Provide user guides and training if necessary.

Phase 5: Post-Transition

	•	Decommission Old SharePoint Site:
	•	Confirm no critical content remains on the old site before disabling access.
	•	Archiving:
	•	Backup and archive the old site’s content for future reference.

5. Timeline

	•	Estimated Schedule:
	•	Content Inventory Preparation: 1 week
	•	Architecture Design: 1 week
	•	Migration Testing: 1 week
	•	Migration and Validation: 2 weeks
	•	User Testing and Optimization: 1 week
	•	Go-Live and Post-Transition: 1 week

6. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

	•	Risk 1: Incompatibility of Migration Tools
	•	Mitigation: Test tools in advance and prepare a manual migration plan as a backup.
	•	Risk 2: Data Loss or Corruption
	•	Mitigation: Ensure complete backup of the old site.
	•	Risk 3: Misconfigured Permissions
	•	Mitigation: Pre-validate permission settings and document them thoroughly.

7. Outputs

	•	New SharePoint site architecture
	•	Migration report (Content inventory, migration status, validation results)
	•	User feedback report
